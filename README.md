## 🚀 Quick Start (3 Steps)

### 1. Install Dependencies

```bash
npm install react-router-dom
```

### 2. Add Your API Key

Create `.env` file in project root:

```env
VITE_API_KEY=your-api-key-here
```

Get your API key from your microservice environment variables.

### 3. Copy Files to Your Project

```
authService.js → src/services/authService.js
useAuth.js → src/hooks/useAuth.js
Login.jsx → src/components/Login.jsx
SignUp.jsx → src/components/SignUp.jsx (replace your existing one)
ProtectedRoute.jsx → src/components/ProtectedRoute.jsx
```

Update your `App.jsx` with the routing example provided.

## ⚠️ Important Notes

1. **Remove demo credentials** from Login component before production
2. **Test thoroughly** before showing to recruiters
3. **Update both GitHub READMEs** with integration details
4. **Fix all typos** in your portfolio descriptions
5. Consider adding **refresh tokens** for better UX

---

## 🆘 Troubleshooting

**"API Key Missing"** → Check your `.env` file and restart dev server  
**CORS Errors** → Check your microservice CORS configuration  
**Token Expired** → Clear localStorage and login again  
**Can't Login** → Verify API is running: `https://auth-microservice-ywe0.onrender.com/api/v1/health`

---

## 📞 Questions?

If something doesn't work:

1. Check browser console
2. Check network tab in DevTools
3. Verify .env file is loaded
4. Test microservice directly with Postman
5. Read IMPLEMENTATION_GUIDE.md
